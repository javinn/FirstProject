   - loop through each item and get the count of 'a'
   - now read the doc and try out `countMatches` method

7. Create a String with a long sentence

   - outside your loop , print to see the result

8. Create a String with a long sentence
   - split the sentence to get word list 
   - create a variable called longestCharCount
   - assign it's value to first item length
   - loop through each item 
      - use `Math.max(longestCharCount, each.length() )`
   - outside your loop , print to see the result of longestCharCount

9. Create a String variable with the value 
   - check if the value is palindrome or not 
   - palindrome read the same from forward or backward
